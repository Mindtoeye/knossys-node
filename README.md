# knossys-node
This codebase represents a coordinating network node in the Knossys cloud infrastructure

# Installation and Running

We provide a number of convenience shell scripts that allow you to rapidly deploy and manage this project on a server. These shells are standardized across the Eberly Center at CMU and you will find the same basic set in every project.

## Using Docker

1. Clone the repository with: git clone https://github.com/Mindtoeye/knossys-node
2. Change into the project directory: cd knossys-node
3. Build the docker image: **./run-dockerfile-build.sh**
4. Run the docker image: **./run-dockerfile.sh**

## Using docker-compose on a production machine

1. Clone the repository with: git clone https://github.com/Mindtoeye/knossys-node
2. Change into the project directory: cd knossys-node
3. Build the docker image: **./run-dockerfile-build.sh**
4. Run the docker image (in dev mode): **./run-compose-dev.sh**

## Local installation on Machine

1. Clone the repository with: git clone https://github.com/Mindtoeye/knossys-node
2. Change into the project directory: cd knossys-node
3. Let Pip install the dependencies and libraries: **./run-install.sh**
4. If successful, execute the application locally on the machine: **./run.sh**

# Shells and DevOps files

* **docker-compose-dev.yml** Development version of the docker-compose configuration. Works the same as the production version except the images aren't automatically restarted. The Compose file is a YAML file defining services, networks, and volumes for a Docker application. The latest and recommended version of the Compose file format is defined by the Compose Specification.

* **docker-compose-prod.yml** Production version of the docker-compose configuration. Meant to be executed as a deamon (see production shell) and all the images are configured to restart automatically. The Compose file is a YAML file defining services, networks, and volumes for a Docker application. The latest and recommended version of the Compose file format is defined by the Compose Specification.

* **Dockerfile** Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. 

* **run-compose-dev.sh** A bash script to run the development version of the project. Use this to see debug output in your console or if you want to run the project in a non-deamon/non-background fashion. Used frequently in a screen session. Uses docker-compose-dev.yml

* **run-compose-prod.sh** A bash script to run the production version of the project. This script is equivalent to how the project will be run on a server. Sometimes the script is used as-is by our Saltstack configuration. Note that this will not show debug output on the console when run. Uses docker-compose-prod.yml

* **run-dockerfile-build.sh** A convenience shell script to build the docker image using the **Dockerfile** file. This script does various checks to verify a system meets the minimum requirements

* **run-dockerfile.sh** Runs the Dockerfile directly through the command line. It makes sure the ports are properly mapped to be used by the outside and it provides a tag so that the resulting container can be easily found when doing a 'Docker ps' or other listing command. Use this option mostly for debugging and use the docker-compose option for production deployment

* **run-install.sh** Installs the required dependencies for local execution (non Docker, non docker-compose). Will do some basic checks on the operating system to verify the prep and installation will succeed

* **run.sh** The most direct and barebones execution of the system. Assumes you've executed **./run-install.sh**

* **run-upgrade.sh** Does a number of package management tasks depending on the platform and project. Upgrades package.json in the case of a webpack or node project. Upgrades pip, python, etc in the case of a Python project
